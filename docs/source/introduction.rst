Introduction
------------

The River Computing (RC) is the SLURM based cluster that allows for mainly bioinformatics usages.

- **Data Analysis**: Perform complex data analysis tasks efficiently.

- **Storage**: Utilize NFS with NAS for centralized and reliable data storage. Integration with cloud storage services like AWS S3 and GCP for flexibility.

- **SLURM Scheduler**: Efficiently manage job scheduling and resource allocation.

- **Resource Allocation**: Fair distribution of CPU cores, memory, GPUs, and storage.

- **GPU Support**: Accelerate computations with GPU-accelerated computing.

- **Parallel Computing**: Parallelize computations across multiple CPU cores or nodes.

- **Workflow Management**: Organize and automate complex computational workflows.
